/// The flags argument to a recv() call is a bitwise or of the constants starting `MSG_*`.
extern "C"
{
	/// Receives data from a socket.
	///
	/// Pass `NULL` for `addr` and `addrlen` for connected sockets (eg TCP connections).
	///
	/// On success, returns the number of bytes sent.
	/// On error, `-1` is returned, and `errno` is set appropriately.
	///
	/// The known errors that can be set in `errno` are:-
	///
	/// * `EAGAIN`: The socket is marked nonblocking and the receive operation would block, or a receive timeout had been set and the timeout expired before data was received.
	/// * `EBADF`: The argument `sockfd` is an invalid descriptor.
	/// * `ECONNREFUSED`: A remote host refused to allow the network connection (typically because it is not running the requested service).
	/// * `EFAULT`: The receive buffer pointer(s) point outside the process's address space.
	/// * `EINTR`: The receive was interrupted by delivery of a signal before any data were available.
	/// * `EINVAL`: Invalid argument passed.
	/// * `ENOMEM`: Could not allocate memory.
	/// * `ENOTCONN`: The socket is associated with a connection-oriented protocol and has not been connected.
	/// * `ENOTSOCK`: The argument `sockfd` does not refer to a socket.
	///
	/// Whilst not documented, it seems possible that `EOPNOTSUPP` could occur (eg because some flags in the `flags` argument are inappropriate for the socket type).
	///
	/// Additionally, [this stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10387082/unix-ipc-socket-closing-one-end-without-reading-from-it) seems to imply that `ECONNRESET` can occur for Unix domain sockets.
