	/// * `EBADF`: The argument `sockfd` is not a valid descriptor.
	/// * `EFAULT`: The address pointed to by `optval` is not in a valid part of the process address space.
	/// * `EINVAL`: `optlen` is invalid, or there is an invalid value in `optval`.
	/// * `ENOPROTOOPT`: The option is unknown at the level indicated.
	/// * `ENOTSOCK`: The argument `sockfd` is a file, not a socket.
