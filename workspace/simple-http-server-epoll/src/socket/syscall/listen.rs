	/// Makes a bound socket a listener.

	///
	/// The known errors that can be set in `errno` are:-
	///
	/// * `EADDRINUSE`: Another socket is already listening on the same port.
	/// * `EBADF`: `sockfd` is not a valid descriptor.
	/// * `ENOTSOCK`: `sockfd` is not a socket file descriptor.
	/// * `EOPNOTSUPP`: The socket is not of a type that supports the `listen()` operation.
