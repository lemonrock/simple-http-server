	/// `inotify_add_watch()` adds a new watch, or modifies an existing watch, for the file whose location is specified in pathname; the caller must have read permission for this file.
	///
	/// The `fd` argument is a file descriptor referring to the inotify instance whose watch list is to be modified.
	/// The events to be monitored for `pathname` are specified in the mask `mask` argument.
	///
	/// A successful call to `inotify_add_watch()` returns the unique watch descriptor associated with pathname for this inotify instance.
	/// If `pathname` was not previously being watched by this inotify instance, then the watch descriptor is newly allocated.
	/// If `pathname` was already being watched, then the descriptor for the existing watch is returned.
	///
	/// The watch descriptor is returned by later `read()` from the inotify file descriptor `fd`.
	/// These reads fetch `inotify_event` structures.
	/// The watch descriptor inside this structure identifies the object for which the event occurred.
	///
	/// On success, `inotify_add_watch()` returns a nonnegative watch descriptor.
	/// On error `-1` is returned and `errno` is set appropriately.
	///
	/// Errors documented to be returned from `inotify_add_watch()` in `errno`:-
	///
	/// * `EACCES`: Read access to the given file is not permitted.
	/// * `EBADF`: `fd` is not a valid file descriptor.
	/// * `EFAULT`: `pathname` points outside of the process's accessible address space.
	/// * `EINVAL`: The given event `mask` contains no valid events; or `fd` is not an inotify file descriptor.
	/// * `ENOENT`: A directory component in `pathname` does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.
	/// * `ENOMEM`: Insufficient kernel memory was available.
	/// * `ENOSPC`: The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource.
	///
	/// Since Linux 2.6.13.
