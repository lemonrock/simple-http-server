	/// `inotify_rm_watch()` removes the watch associated with the watch descriptor `wd` from the inotify instance associated with the file descriptor `fd`.

	/// Removing a watch causes an `IN_IGNORED` event to be generated for this watch descriptor.
	///
	/// On success, `inotify_rm_watch()` returns zero.
	/// On error `-1` is returned and `errno` is set appropriately.
	///
	/// Errors documented to be returned from `inotify_rm_watch()` in `errno`:-
	///
	/// * `EBADF`: `fd` is not a valid file descriptor.
	/// * `EINVAL`: The watch descriptor `wd` is not valid; or `fd` is not an inotify file descriptor.
	///
	/// Since Linux 2.6.13.
