	/// When calling `fanotify_init()`, the caller may specify (via the `event_f_flags` argument) various file status flags that are to be set on the open file description that corresponds to this file descriptor.

	/// In addition, the (kernel-internal) `FMODE_NONOTIFY` file status flag is set on the open file description.
	/// This flag suppresses fanotify event generation.
	/// Hence, when the receiver of the fanotify event accesses the notified file or directory using this file descriptor, no additional events will be created.
