{
	/// `fanotify_mark()` adds, removes, or modifies an fanotify mark on a filesystem object.
	///
	/// The caller must have read permission on the filesystem object that is to be marked.
	///
	/// `flags` is a bit mask describing the modification to perform.
	/// It must include exactly one of `FAN_MARK_ADD`, `FAN_MARK_REMOVE` or `FAN_MARK_FLUSH`.
	///
	/// `mask` defines which events shall be listened for (or which shall be ignored).
	/// It is a bit mask of `FAN_ACCESS`, `FAN_MODIFY`, `FAN_CLOSE_WRITE`, `FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE`, `FAN_OPEN`, `FAN_Q_OVERFLOW`, `FAN_OPEN_PERM`, `FAN_ACCESS_PERM`, `FAN_ONDIR` and `FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD`.
	///
	/// The filesystem object to be marked is determined by the file descriptor `dirfd` and the pathname specified in `pathname`:-
	///
	/// * If pathname is `NULL`, `dirfd` defines the filesystem object to be marked.
	/// * If pathname is `NULL`, and `dirfd` takes the special value `AT_FDCWD`, the current working directory is to be marked.
	/// * If pathname is absolute, it defines the filesystem object to be marked, and `dirfd` is ignored.
	/// * If pathname is relative, and `dirfd` does not have the value `AT_FDCWD`, then the filesystem object to be marked is determined by interpreting `pathname` relative the directory referred to by `dirfd`.
	/// * If pathname is relative, and `dirfd` has the value `AT_FDCWD`, then the filesystem object to be marked is determined by interpreting `pathname` relative the current working directory.
	///
	/// On success, `fanotify_mark()` returns `0`.
	/// On error, `-1` is returned, and `errno` is set to indicate the error.
	///
	/// Errors documented to be returned from `fanotify_mark()` in `errno`:-
	///
	/// * `EBADF`: An invalid file descriptor was passed in `fanotify_fd`.
	/// * `EINVAL`: An invalid value was passed in `flags` or `mask`, or `fanotify_fd` was not an fanotify file descriptor, or the fanotify file descriptor was opened with `FAN_CLASS_NOTIF` and mask contains a flag for permission events (`FAN_OPEN_PERM` or `FAN_ACCESS_PERM`).
	/// * `ENOENT`: The filesystem object indicated by `dirfd` and `pathname` does not exist. This error also occurs when trying to remove a mark from an object which is not marked.
	/// * `ENOMEM`: The necessary memory could not be allocated.
	/// * `ENOSPC`: The number of marks exceeds the limit of `8192` and the `FAN_UNLIMITED_MARKS` flag was not specified when the fanotify file descriptor was created with `fanotify_init()`.
	/// * `ENOSYS` This kernel does not implement `fanotify_mark()`. The fanotify API is available only if the kernel was configured with `CONFIG_FANOTIFY`.
	/// * `ENOTDIR`: `flags` contains `FAN_MARK_ONLYDIR`, and `dirfd` and `pathname` do not specify a directory.
