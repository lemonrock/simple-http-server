/// Allows for customization of responses to signals.
///
/// Signals can be raised by the kernel or by user space; they can even be raised 'internally' by the libc.
///
/// When raised by user space, they are not necessarily populated with the same data.
/// Hence this signal handler differentiates between kernel and the various user space equivalents.
///
/// Signals have an associated `errno` field, but this is not passed to the handlers as Linux only ever populates it for device events in the USB URBS core, and these are raised as `SI_ASYNCIO` to mimic user space.
///
/// The signals `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` can not be handled.
///
/// The signal `SIGEMT` can only occur on Alpha, MIPS and SPARC architectures (although Rust does not support the Alpha architecture).
///
// Sadly, the Linux kernel's implementation of user signal handling is still weak, despite CVE-2011-1182 (a kernel signal spoofing issue), and so one can not trust `si_code` nor the associated data.
