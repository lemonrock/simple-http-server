	///
 	/// Sets an exclusive wakeup mode for the epoll file descriptor that is being attached to the target file descriptor, `fd`.
	/// When a wakeup event occurs and multiple epoll file descriptors are attached to the same target file using `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE`, one or more of the epoll file descriptors will receive an event with `epoll_wait()`.
	/// The default in this scenario (when `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` is not set) is for all epoll file descriptors to receive an event.
	/// `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` is thus useful for avoiding thundering herd problems in certain scenarios.
	///
	/// If the same file descriptor is in multiple epoll instances, some with the `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` flag, and others without, then events will be provided to all epoll instances that did not specify `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE`, and at least one of the epoll instances that did specify `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE`.

	/// The following values may be specified in conjunction with `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE`: `EPOLLIN`, `EPOLLOUT`, `EPOLLWAKEUP`, and `EPOLLET`.
	/// `EPOLLHUP` and `EPOLLERR` can also be specified, but this is not required; these events are always reported if they occur, regardless of whether they are specified in events.
	/// Attempts to specify other values in `events` yield an error.
	/// `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` may be used only in an `EPOLL_CTL_ADD` operation; attempts to employ it with `EPOLL_CTL_MOD` yield an error.
	/// If `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` has been set using `epoll_ctl()`, then a subsequent `EPOLL_CTL_MOD` on the same `epfd`, `fd` pair yields an error.
	/// A call to `epoll_ctl()` that specifies `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` in `events` and specifies the target file descriptor `fd` as an epoll instance will likewise fail.
	/// The error in all of these cases is `EINVAL`.
