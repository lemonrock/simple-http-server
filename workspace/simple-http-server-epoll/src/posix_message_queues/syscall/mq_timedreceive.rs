{
	/// `mq_timedreceive()` removes the oldest message with the highest priority from the message queue referred to by the message queue descriptor  `mqdes`, and places it in the buffer pointed to by `msg_ptr`.
	///
	/// The `msg_len` argument specifies the size of the buffer pointed to by `msg_ptr`; this must be greater than or equal to the `mq_msgsize` attribute of the queue.
	/// If `msg_prio` is not `NULL`, then the buffer to which it points is used to return the priority associated with the received message.
	///
	/// If the queue is empty, then, by default, `mq_receive()` then the call instead fails immediately with the error `EAGAIN`.
	///
	/// `abs_timeout` can be `NULL` (this mirrors then `mq_receive()`).
	///
	/// On success, `mq_timedreceive()` returns the number of bytes in the received message.
	/// On error, `-1` is returned, with `errno` set to indicate the error.
	///
	/// Errors documented to be returned from `mq_getattr()` in `errno`:-
	///
	/// * `EAGAIN`: The queue was empty, and the `O_NONBLOCK` flag was set for the message queue description referred to by `mqdes`.
	/// * `EBADF`: The descriptor specified in `mqdes` was invalid or not opened for reading.
	/// * `EINTR`: The call was interrupted by a signal handler.
	/// * `EINVAL`: The call would have blocked, and `abs_timeout` was invalid, either because `tv_sec` was less than zero, or because `tv_nsec` was less than zero or greater than 1000 million.
	/// * `EMSGSIZE`: `msg_len` was less than the `mq_msgsize` attribute of the message queue.
	/// * `ETIMEDOUT`: The call timed out before a message could be transferred.
